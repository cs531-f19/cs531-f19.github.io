The student will implement an HTTP server with five assignments that demonstrate protocol conformance.
The assignments will build on the previous assignments, and at the end of the class the student should have a fully functioning web server that implements most of the common HTTP functionalities.
There will be no class textbooks; class lectures and RFCs will be the primary guide for students.
Grades will be determine solely on the design and performance of the HTTP servers.

Students will have their own HTTP server implementation in their private GitHub repositories with the instructor added as a collaborator in each repository to allow code access for review and testing.
Each server will be deployed in a Docker container for testing on a remote machine.
