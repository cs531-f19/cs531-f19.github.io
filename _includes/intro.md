This class will focus on the complete understanding of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the implementation of a web server.
The class will be programming intensive: prerequisites include the understanding of network (socket) programming.
The students will decide their own implementation language within the Unix/Linux environment; the lectures will be strictly about
HTTP and not about any particular programming language.
