## Cloud Hosting Tutorial

* Create a step by step tutorial (cf. [GitHub tutorial](/slides/lecture-01-github.pdf)) for setting up a cloud server in [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), or any other cloud service (there are ways to get some free compute credits via [GitHub Education bundle](https://education.github.com/students), directly from various cloud providers, or via referral programs)
* Illustrate how to run a service on specific port (ideally, your echo server from [Assignment 0-1](/assignments/assignment-0-1)) and access it remotely
* Fork [course discussion repository](https://github.com/cs531-f19/discussions), place your tutorial under `tutorials/` folder, and issue a pull request
* 5 points for the 1st person to complete this, 4 points for the 2nd person, etc.
