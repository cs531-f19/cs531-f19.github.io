## Part 1 - Join GitHub

* Set up an account on GitHub, if not already
* Leverage [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/students) for lots of goodies

## Part 2 - Subscribe to the discussion board repository

* Subscribe to the [course discussion repository](https://github.com/cs531-f19/discussions) by watching it for all notification
* Reply to the [Introduce yourself](https://github.com/cs531-f19/discussions/issues/1) thread
* This repository is public, so be careful about what you share there

## Part 3 - Create your private assignment repository

* Create a private repository for your server implementation, name it whatever you like
* Add `ibnesayeed` (me) as a collaborator (but no one else) so that I can access the code for review and evaluation
* The repository must be private, public repositories will not be graded!

## Part 4 - Tell me what your assignment repository is

* [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the [course discussion repository](https://github.com/cs531-f19/discussions)
* Clone your forked version locally
* Add your `CS ID`, `Full Name`, `GitHub ID`, and `Private Repository Name` in the `members.csv` file
* Commit your changes locally, then push them to your GiHub fork
* Issue a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) to the original discussion repository so I can gather necessary data for automated testing and evaluations
