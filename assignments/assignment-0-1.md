## Echo Server in Docker

* Write a simple echo back server in your chosen programming language in your private assignment repository (an echo server returns the same message that it receives)
* Add a `Dockerfile` at the root of your repository to run your echo server in a container (ask for help in the [course discussion repository](https://github.com/cs531-f19/discussions), if needed)
* Set the default port of your server to `80` when running in a Docker container (but make it configurable)
* Validate your implementation on the [testing server](https://cs531.cs.odu.edu/) against `echo` test suite
